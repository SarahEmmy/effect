## Concepts

In the course of this project, we will explore the following key concepts:

- REST API
- AirBnB Clone
- HTTP access control (CORS)
- Flask
- Flask Blueprints
- Flask tests
- Flask-CORS

## Learning Objectives

Throughout the project, we aim to achieve the following learning objectives:

- Understanding the concept of REST and its practical applications
- Grasping the fundamentals of API and its significance in modern web development
- Mastering the implementation of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for secure API communication
- Developing a comprehensive understanding of the various HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, in the context of resource manipulation
- Exploring Flask's capabilities in building modular and scalable web applications
